## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(DBI) #DataBase Interface
library(dbplyr)
library(odbc) #OpenDataBaseConnectivity

odbcListDrivers()

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc(),
                      Driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server",
                      Server = "mcobsql.business.nd.edu",
                      UID = "MSBAstudent",
                      PWD = "SQL%database!Mendoza",
                      Port = 3306, 
                      Database = "ChicagoCrime")

dbListFields(con, "crimes")

dbListFields(con, "wards")

#we can join crimes and wards using ward

select_q <- dbSendQuery(
  conn = con, 
  statement = "SELECT sub_table.ward
      ,sub_table.category
      ,sub_table.subcategory
      ,wards.percentIncomeOver150K
      ,sub_table.Frequency
      FROM (
SELECT RANK() OVER
        (PARTITION BY c.ward 
        ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS Rank
       ,c.ward
       ,i.category
       ,i.subcategory
       ,COUNT(*) AS Frequency
FROM dbo.crimes c
INNER JOIN dbo.IUCR i
ON c.IUCR = i.IUCR
INNER JOIN dbo.wards w
ON c.ward = w.ward
GROUP BY c.ward, i.category, i.subcategory
) AS sub_table
INNER JOIN dbo.wards
ON sub_table.ward = wards.ward
WHERE Rank = 1
ORDER BY wards.percentIncomeOver150K desc
"
)

select_res <- dbFetch(select_q)

dbClearResult(select_q)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

theft <- select_res[select_res$category == 'Theft', ]

ggplot(select_res, aes(x = 'percentIncomeOver150k', y = 'Frequency')) +
         geom_point()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
